Things that could have been done:

* Added specs but never got a chance to hook up instrumentation via orchestra.
* The results page date isn't formatted in a human friendly way.
* Show a bit more info on the results page.
* Style the results page.
* Be able to unit test the api call with a fixture/with-redefs
* Take all the address components from the form and hit google maps api to find
  more info such as county.
* Ideally, replace the form with google place autocomplete for better UX,
  and getting all the locality/geocoding in one shot.
